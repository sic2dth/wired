            A list of books that I recommend
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of these books focus on philosophy, Artifical Intelligence and the internet as a whole

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a> - George Orwell</a></li>
            <p> George Orwell's dystopian novel "1984" paints a haunting picture of a totalitarian society in which the government controls every aspect of citizens' lives. The novel is a powerful critique of the dangers of government control, as well as a warning of what can happen if we surrender our freedom and individuality. The writing is simple, and the themes are timeless, making this a must-read for anyone interested in societal power dynamics.</p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep">Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep?</a> - Philip K.Dick</a></li>
            <p>	The novel revolves around a bounty hunter tasked with retiring rogue androids that have infiltrated society, and raises questions about the nature of consciousness, reality, and what it means to be human. The story was adapted for the screen in 1982 for 'The Blade Runner' and was directed by Ridley Scott. While the film deviates in some ways from the book, it remains faithful to the central themes and ideas explored in the original novel, such as the relationship between androids and humans, the nature of reality and consciousness, and the search for what it means to be truly alive.</p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">DUNE</a> - Frank Herbert</a></li>
            <p>		Although Dune is a difficult read, the characters and factions (houses) provide an enthralling experience to any type of reader; sci-fi or other. Frank Herbert provides an eerily realistic setting. It is set in a distant future and revolves around a young man named Paul Atreides, who becomes embroiled in the political landscape of a desert planet named Arrakis, which is the only source of a valuable resource called "spice." Paul's journey leads him to become the leader of the native people of Arrakis, known as the Fremen, as he battles for control of the spice and the fate of the planet. The book explores themes of power, religion, ecology, and humanity's relationship with technology.            </p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0">Life 3.0</a> - Max Tegmark</a></li>
            <p>		Tegmark defines "Life 3.0" as a hypothetical future stage of life where intelligent beings, including AI, are capable of creating and guiding their own evolution. The point of "Life 3.0" is to examine the challenges and opportunities that come with the development of advanced AI and to consider the ethical and philosophical implications of creating machines that can surpass human intelligence.            </p>
        
            <br><br>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)">Republic</a> - Plato</a></li>
            <p>		Perhaps the greatest conversation about the nature of justice and the ideal form of a government. Socrates engages with other Athenian citizens about the proper structure of society. The book also addresses issues of education, morality, and human nature, as well as questions about the nature of reality, knowledge, and the role of the philosopher in society. Overall, the point of "The Republic" is to offer a comprehensive examination of the nature of justice and to present Plato's vision of an ideal society and the path to achieving it.            </p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a> - William Gibson</a></li>
            <p>	The defining book for the "Cyberpunk" genre and is a must read for those interested in the cyberspace genre. The book may not be easy to read for people due to its complex narrative structure or its heavy use of technical jargon.</p>
        
            <br><br>


            <!--7--><img src="https://i.ibb.co/r7NBS1s/7.webp" width="64" height="97" alt="1984 cover" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding: 2px;" />
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Five_Rings">The Book Of Five Rings</a> - Miyamoto Musashi</a></li>
            <p>		Miyamoto Musashi is widely considered to be one of the greatest swordsmen in Japanese history and is famous for his unique two-sword fighting style.The book mainly focuses on strategy and martial arts but also mental awareness, mental discipline and spirituality in martial arts.            </p>
        
            <br><br>


            <!--8--><img src="https://i.ibb.co/W0D9CQ6/8.webp" width="64" height="97" alt="1984 cover" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding: 2px;" />
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_from_Underground">Notes from Underground</a> - Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a></li>
            <p>		Dostoevsky's work has influenced numerous other writers, thinkers, and movements, including existentialism, psychology, and even political ideology. His impact continues to be felt today, as his works are still widely read and discussed, and his themes and characters continue to resonate with contemporary readers.            </p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea_(novel)">Nausea</a> - Jean-Paule Sartre</a></li>
            <p>	A challenging and philosophical read but a rewarding experience regardless.</p>
        
            <br><br>


            <!--10--><img src="https://i.ibb.co/KbZ8v80/10.webp" width="64" height="97" alt="1984 cover" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding: 2px;" />
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_(Kawakami_novel)">Heaven</a> - Mieko Kawakami</a></li>
            <p>		This intricately written and translated book explores complex philosophical and religious themes regarding intention, free will, weakness vs. strength, and other topics. Even though all of these are challenging subjects, the book keeps you interested and makes you want to read more.            </p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World">Brave New World</a> - Aldous Huxley</a></li>
            <p>		One of my favourite books of all time and one that has aged really well over the years. Do yourself a favour and pick up this book at the earliest.            </p>
        
            <br><br>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectures_on_Aesthetics">Indroductory lectures on aesthetics</a> - Georg Hegel</a></li>
            <p>		Hegel's 19th century classic on art history and art criticism is a thought provoking and fantastic read for those interested in philosophy and art theory.             </p>
        
            <br><br>


            <!--13--><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1rrRD5b/13.webp" width="64" height="97" alt="1984 cover" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding: 2px;" />
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snow_crash">Snow Crash</a> - Neal Stephenson</a></li>
            <p>		An interesting read that takes place in a technologically advanced modern America where knowledge, religion, and government have all been franchised by the expansion of global commerce. Populations reside in heavily guarded zones, and the Internet is practically real. It's a wonderful world to be young and adventurous in, especially if you're just old enough to have participated in the creation of the early Internet hacks.            </p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero_to_one">Zero to One</a> - Blake Masters, Peter Thiel</a></li>
            <p>	The strategy employed by Peter Thiel appears to turn any conventional thinking on its head, reevaluate paradigms, and ultimately motivate the reader to create something new. Thiel has a history of finding and funding businesses that transform industries and societies. He was one of the founders of PayPal and Palantir, one of the first outside investors in Facebook, a funder of SpaceX, and LinkedIn.            </p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ikigai">Ikigai</a> - Hector Garcia</a></li>
            <p>		The Japanese believe that everyone has an ikigai, or reason for existing. Finding it is the secret to a happier and longer life, according to the inhabitants of the Japanese village with the world's longest-living people. Ikigai reveals their hidden methods, including what they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster community, and—perhaps most importantly—how they discover the ikigai that makes their lives satisfying.            </p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Final_Invention">Our final invention</a> - James Barret</a></li>
            <p>	James Barret talks about what is known as the 'singularity' in AI technology. The singularity loosely defined is the last invention that man would have to make. The AI would be smarter than humans and wholly uncontrollable. Being a fanatic about AI technology and computer science, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested or wants to know more about this growing space.            </p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paths_of_Glory">Paths of Glory</a> - Humphrey Cobb</a></li>
            <p>		I was introduced to this book after watching Stanley Kubrick's 1957 movie by the same name. Three French soldiers are set to be executed during World War I as retribution for a regiment's failure to attack the German Army position on the Western Front.            </p>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(novel)">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> - Douglas Adams</a></li>
            <p>	A series of silly and satirical sci-fi books and perhaps Adams' best work.</p>
